# Feature Selection and Classification of Breast Cancer Dataset

This repository contains the code and documentation for a guided project completed through the Coursera Project Network. The project focuses on feature selection and classification using the Breast Cancer Diagnostic dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## About The Data

The Breast Cancer Diagnostic data is available on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29). This database is also accessible through the UW CS ftp server.

Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. The 3-dimensional space is described in: [K. P. Bennett and O. L. Mangasarian: "Robust Linear Programming Discrimination of Two Linearly Inseparable Sets", Optimization Methods and Software 1, 1992, 23-34].

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to perform feature selection and classification on the Breast Cancer Diagnostic dataset. The main steps include:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
2. **Feature Selection**: Identifying the most relevant features for classification.
3. **Model Training**: Training machine learning models to classify the data.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the models.
